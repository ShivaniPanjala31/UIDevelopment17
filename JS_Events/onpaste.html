      A fairy tale is a short story that belongs to the folklore genre. Such
      stories typically feature magic, enchantments, and mythical or fanciful
      beings. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk
      or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate
      societies. A fairy tale is a short story that belongs to the folklore
